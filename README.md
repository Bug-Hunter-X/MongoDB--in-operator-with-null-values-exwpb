# MongoDB $in operator with null values

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator with null values in MongoDB queries.  The `$in` operator is intended to match documents where a field's value is present within a provided array. However, it handles null values in an unexpected manner, potentially leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Description
Incorrectly using `$in` with a null value in the array may cause the query to either fail or return unexpected results, depending on the MongoDB version and the index used.

## Solution
The solution is to check for null values separately, or handle them explicitly within the query using the `$or` operator.
